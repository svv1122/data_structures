=====================
One Dimensional Array
=====================
A one-dimensional array is a linear data structure that stores a sequence of elements in a single row.
Each element is stored at a specific index, starting from zero, and can be accessed directly using its index.

All elements are stored in **contiguous memory locations**, allowing for fast access and traversal.

Example (C-style syntax): `int arr[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};`

Key Characteristics:
- Fixed size (in static arrays)
- Same data type for all elements
- Direct access using index: `arr[i]`
- Time complexity for access: **O(1)**
