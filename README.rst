*Reference*: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure`
In computer science, a data structure is a **data organization** and **storage format** that 
is usually chosen for efficient access to data.[1][2][3] More precisely, a data structure 
is a collection of **data values**, the **relationships** among them, and the functions or 
operations that can be applied to the data,[4] i.e., it is an algebraic structure about data. 

*Note*: Implement all data structures in **C**
