Data Structure
==============
In computer science (CS), a data structure comprises both **data storage or format** 
and associated **operations**, typically selected to enable efficient data access. 
Simultaneously, each element within a data structure exhibits interrelations or mutual 
influence, whether in terms of **definition** or **underlying physical** representation. 
Data structures can be classified into various categories, including linear, tree, set, 
graph, hash, among others. From these classifications, numerous specialized algorithms 
have been developed to fully exploit the unique characteristics of each type. To facilitate 
a progressive understanding for the reader, I provide not only relevant code snippets and 
specific literature references, but also vivid explanations and illustrative diagrams to 
foster a more intuitive comprehension.
